# DynaMix .natvis

This is a debug visualizer extension for DynaMix. It allows you to see the contents of a DynaMix object in the debugger. IDEs which support the natvis format include Visual Studio, CLion, and Visual Studio Code.

For best results they also need to be combined with .natvis files from [itlib](https://github.com/iboB/itlib), which can be found [here](https://github.com/iboB/itlib/tree/master/tools/vs).
