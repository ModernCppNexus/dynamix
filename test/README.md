# DynaMix Tests

Unit and unit-like tests of the library's features, including fuzzing tests. `app-plugin` is likely the closest to an integration test there is.

Powered by [doctest](https://github.com/doctest/doctest) (via [doctest-util](https://github.com/iboB/doctest-util)) for C++ and [Unity](https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Unity) for C.

This is not the most suitable place to learn how to use the library. Try the [examples](../example) instead.
