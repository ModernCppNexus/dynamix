# Roadmap

Here's a list of notable planned new features and updates for DynaMix

* Soon
    * [New feature: Fact](https://github.com/iboB/dynamix/issues/45). Facts are like static variables. Available for the type (no need for an object). Get-value only.
    * [Allow object construction from a mutation](https://github.com/iboB/dynamix/issues/59).
    * [Optimize type lookup and mutations](https://github.com/iboB/dynamix/issues/57)
    * Demo: [multicast reduce/accumulate](https://github.com/iboB/dynamix/issues/49)
    * Demo: [app](https://github.com/iboB/dynamix/issues/50) several domains and idiomatic project structure
    * Demo: [self-locking objects](https://github.com/iboB/dynamix/issues/54)
    * Demo: [multiple dispatch](https://github.com/iboB/dynamix/issues/53)
* Not soon
    * Public case study: A demo project, that better illustrates the libraries functionalities in a "real life" scenario. Complete with a document which gives problems for motivation and their DynaMix solutions.
    * Zig bindings and inteface
    * Demo: lua integration
    * Demo: JS and wasm integration
* Possibly never, but sounds nice
    * Create a preprocessing tool (like Qt's moc) that can be used instead of the macros for mixin and feature definition
